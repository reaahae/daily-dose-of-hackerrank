# 💊 Daily Dose of HackerRank

Welcome to my **Daily Dose of HackerRank** — a fun and structured way to strengthen my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) skills. Each “💊 Dose” in this repository represents a topic-focused set of problems I'm solving regularly on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), complete with explanations, code, and clean structure.

## 🧠 Why This Repo?

- ✅ Build consistent problem-solving habits
- 🚀 Prepare for coding interviews and contests
- 📚 Organize solutions topic-wise with clarity
- 💼 Showcase my growth and GitHub activity
