### ğŸ§  Problem Summary

ğŸ§® **Problem Statement**  
Given an array of integers where all elements except one occur twice, find the element that occurs only once.

ğŸ“¥ **Input**  
- The first line contains a single integer, `n`, the number of integers in the array.  
- The second line contains `n` space-separated integers.

ğŸ“¤ **Output**  
- Print the integer that occurs only once.

ğŸ“Œ **Constraints**  
- 1 <= n < 100  
- It is guaranteed that exactly one integer occurs once and the rest occur in pairs.

### ğŸš€ Approach

ğŸ“Œ **Approach:**  
Use **bitwise XOR** to find the unique element.

**Why this approach?**  
- XOR of a number with itself is 0: `x ^ x = 0`  
- XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself: `x ^ 0 = x`  
- Therefore, all paired elements cancel each other out, leaving the unique one.

**Steps:**  
1. Initialize a variable `result = 0`.  
2. Iterate through the array and XOR each element with `result`.  
3. The final value of `result` is the lonely integer.
