### ðŸ§  Problem Summary

ðŸ§® **Problem Statement**  
You are given a list of integers where each value is in the range `0` to `99`. You need to return a frequency array of size 100, where each element at index `i` indicates the number of times `i` appeared in the input list.

ðŸ“¥ **Input**  
- An array of integers in the range `0` to `99`.

ðŸ“¤ **Output**  
- A list of 100 integers representing the frequency of each value.

ðŸ“Œ **Constraints**  
- 100 >= len(arr) >= 1  
- 0 <= arr[i] < 100

---

### ðŸš€ Approach

ðŸ“Œ **Approach:**  
Use a fixed-size list of 100 elements initialized to 0 and increment the count at each index corresponding to the value encountered.

**Why this approach?**  
- Constant time indexing.  
- Optimal for bounded ranges (0â€“99).  
- Simple and efficient.

**Steps:**  
1. Create a list of 100 zeros.  
2. Iterate over each number in the input array.  
3. Increment the count at the corresponding index.  
4. Return the frequency list.

### ðŸ§® Time & Space Complexity

| Metric        | Value     |
|---------------|-----------|
| ðŸ•’ Time        | `O(n)`    |  
| ðŸ§  Space       | `O(1)`    | (Since result size is fixed: 100)

### ðŸ“˜ Concepts Learnt

- âœ… **Counting Sort Basics**  
  Counting sort is an integer sorting algorithm suitable when the range of input values is known and limited.  
  ðŸ“Œ **Usage**: Instead of sorting directly, it counts occurrences of each number and reconstructs the sorted result.

- âœ… **Frequency Array**  
  A fixed-size list is used to track how many times each value (0 to 99) appears.  
  ðŸ“Œ **Example**: `result[5] = 3` means the number `5` appears 3 times.

- âœ… **List Initialization in Python**  
  `result = [0] * 100` creates a list of 100 zeros efficiently.  
  ðŸ“Œ **Why**: Prevents manual or loop-based initialization.

- âœ… **In-Place Counting with Indexing**  
  Accessing list elements by index (e.g., `result[i] += 1`) is fast and constant time.  
  ðŸ“Œ **Advantage**: No need for nested loops or complex logic.

- âœ… **Space-Time Tradeoff**  
  Counting sort uses extra space (O(k) where k is the range of values) to achieve better time complexity (O(n)).

- âœ… **Zero-Based Indexing**  
  The input values are assumed to be in the range [0, 99], making it ideal to use them directly as indices in the frequency array.
