### ğŸ§  Problem Summary

ğŸ§® **Problem Statement**  
Given an array of integers where all elements except one occur twice, find the element that occurs only once.

ğŸ“¥ **Input**  
- The first line contains a single integer, `n`, the number of integers in the array.  
- The second line contains `n` space-separated integers.

ğŸ“¤ **Output**  
- Print the integer that occurs only once.

ğŸ“Œ **Constraints**  
- 1 <= n < 100  
- It is guaranteed that exactly one integer occurs once and the rest occur in pairs.

### ğŸš€ Approach

ğŸ“Œ **Approach:**  
Use **bitwise XOR** to find the unique element.

**Why this approach?**  
- XOR of a number with itself is 0: `x ^ x = 0`  
- XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself: `x ^ 0 = x`  
- Therefore, all paired elements cancel each other out, leaving the unique one.

**Steps:**  
1. Initialize a variable `result = 0`.  
2. Iterate through the array and XOR each element with `result`.  
3. The final value of `result` is the lonely integer.

| Metric        | Value     |
|---------------|-----------|
| ğŸ•’ Time        | `O(n)`    |  
| ğŸ§  Space       | `O(1)`    |

### ğŸ“˜ Concepts Learnt

- âœ… **Bitwise XOR and Its Properties**  
  Mastered how XOR can be leveraged to detect the unique element in an array where every other element appears twice:
  - `x ^ x = 0`
  - `x ^ 0 = x`  
  ğŸ“Œ This makes it a great fit for problems with paired elements and a single outlier.

- âœ… **Space-Efficient Algorithm**  
  Solved the problem using only a single integer variable (`unique`) â€” no extra lists, sets, or dictionaries used.  
  ğŸ“Œ Efficient for both memory and time.

- âœ… **Minimalist Python Logic**  
  Wrote a fully functional solution in just a few lines without compromising on clarity or correctness.  
  ğŸ“Œ Showcased the power of Python when combined with bitwise logic.

- âœ… **Mathematical Thinking over Brute Force**  
  Avoided brute-force counting or sorting approaches.  
  ğŸ“Œ Choose a mathematical bit manipulation method which scales better.

- âœ… **Interview-Ready Insight**  
  Practiced a common interview question with a classic XOR trick that often appears in technical rounds.
