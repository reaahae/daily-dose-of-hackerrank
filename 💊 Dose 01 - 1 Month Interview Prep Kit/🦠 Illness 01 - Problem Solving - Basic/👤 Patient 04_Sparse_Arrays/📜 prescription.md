### ğŸ§  Problem Summary

ğŸ§® **Problem Statement**  
You are given `n` strings and `q` query strings. For each query string, determine how many times it occurs in the list of input strings.

ğŸ“¥ **Input**  
- The first line contains an integer `n`, the number of strings.  
- The next `n` lines each contain a string.  
- The next line contains an integer `q`, the number of queries.  
- The next `q` lines each contain a query string.

ğŸ“¤ **Output**  
- For each query, print the number of occurrences of the query string in the original list.

ğŸ“Œ **Constraints**  
- 1 <= n, q <= 1000  
- Each string consists of lowercase English letters only.

### ğŸš€ Approach

ğŸ“Œ **Approach:**  
Use Pythonâ€™s `collections.Counter` to count frequencies of strings and quickly access counts for each query.

**Why this approach?**  
- Fast lookup: Dictionary access with `Counter` is O(1).  
- Clean and readable implementation.  
- Built-in functions reduce risk of logical errors.

**Steps:**  
1. Count the occurrences of each string in the input list using `Counter`.  
2. For each query string, fetch its count using dictionary access.  
3. Return the list of counts.

### ğŸ§® Time & Space Complexity

| Metric        | Value     |
|---------------|-----------|
| ğŸ•’ Time        | `O(n + q)`|  
| ğŸ§  Space       | `O(n)`    |
